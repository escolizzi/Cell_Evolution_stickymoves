# Cell_Evolution_stickymoves
TSTO rip-off ++

use the ce_new_regulation branch, it is the only updated one.

The code in its current form runs a simulation of cell evolution 
to investigate the circumstances under which grouping (sticking) of cells occurs. 
Cells eat food that is trickled in at random positions, either homogeneously or in patches.
Cells need food to maintain their mass, grow and divide, and to move. Division of resources among these tasks is evolvable and 
may be regulated through cell contact, cell size and amount of resources available.
Cell adhesion is governed by a key-lock mechanism that evolves, and the amount of sticking at any given moment can be regulated
by the same factors as growth and movement in an evolvable manner.
